Queue


Customers who are waiting to make transactions in a bank located in a residential area with a low population density 
are in a “queue”. The employees who perform the operations are located in a “stack”. The Bank is considering using 
employees as a "stack" to run some of its employees in transactions of its customers to the maximum, and some of 
its employees who are unable to provide service to its customers due to its "stack" structure in some other office 
work. In this way, the employee working at the desk will be less distracted and she/he will complete the work 
efficiently. Suppose you have 6 employees (the number of employees is fixed in this study and it is 6) (employee ids 
are given 1 to 6, employee 6 is at the top of stack) in the bank.
